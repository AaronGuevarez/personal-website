    <p id="description_paragraph" class="everything">Hey there! For anyone who doesn't know me yet, my name is Aaron Guevarez. Honestly, I'm not exactly sure what to write here. This is because I've never had to make a personal website before. I'm sure I'll be able to find a good use for this. Maybe it could be for business-related things. Or something else. But for now, I guess I should put a little description of myself here. At the time that I am writing this, I am currently a rising senior at the High School of Art and Design. But I am also a student at the summer intensive program known as All Star Code. I love drawing and playing sports. I prefer to draw things digitally, and the sports I like are soccer and volleyball. Oh! My dream job? Hah! Yeah I'm honestly not too sure these days. I'm pretty sure I want to work as an animator. But at the same time, the thought of being a professional athlete makes me happy. The problem is, I didn't start practicing any sports at a young age like how you're supposed to when you want to pursue that type of career. So I'm actually terrible at both soccer and volleyball even though I really do love them. That's... super embarassing. But so many people nowadays try to motivate you by saying all kinds of inspirational things. "Don't give up on your dream" they say... Oh! And there's also the classic one: "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish ANYTHING!!!". I'm sure that's true to a great extent. And I would never say this to discourage anyone: but it's not like any of us could actually become omnipotent if we so desire. I mean, come on, I'm 17 years old and I'm over here with my head in the clouds dreaming about playing soccer or volleyball for a living. It definitely sounds like wishful thinking to me. I don't want to be a pessimist or give up on my dream. It just doesn't seem very realistic. And there's logistics and technicalities that go into pursuing any and every type of job. Like... who do I reach out to? What are all the qualities I need? Do I have to sign a contract with someone? Where do I even start? And how am I supposed to start today? Sheesh... thinking about all of this is so exhausting. At least I know I can definitely become an animator if I really want to. I mean, I'm already in an art school and looking into attending an art college. So I know I'll definitely find job opportunities if I continue to walk down this path. But sometimes... I can't help but think I wish I was walking down the other one instead. And other times, I can't help but think that I should just choose whichever job pays me more. I know people say not to think about that, and that you should just do something you love doing. But if I love both art and sports, then I'm already doing what they're telling me to. Right? It's not a bad thing to want a lot of money... hehe. Ooo! I've heard that there's people who play videogames for a living! That sounds sooooooooo cool!!! I don't know how I would go about doing that though. At the moment, I'm already doing everything I can to secure my future. At least I think I am. So I guess all I can do besides that is just hope for the best.
